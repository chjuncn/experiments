Prompt:

I would like you to create an output array of zero or more JSON objects that describe objects of type Rows.
You will use the information in an input JSON object that I will provide. The input object has type Table.
If fields in the output objects cannot be derived using information from the input object, please use None. 
Here is a description of the input object: A Table is an object composed of a header and rows..

Here is every input field name and a description: 
filename: The name of the file the table was extracted from
header: The header of the table
name: The name of the table
rows: The rows of the table

Here is every output field name and a description:
ages: The patient age of all rows.

Be sure to emit a JSON object only. The root-level JSON object should have a single field, called 'items' that is a dictoionary of the output objects. The key of each output object should be one of the output fields described above, the value is a list of values for this key. You must decide the correct number of output objects.

Please scan the input section by section.

0. BaseScan(biofabric-tiny,XLSFile(contents, filename, number_sheets, sheet_names))
1. ConvertScan(XLSFile(contents, filename, number_sheets, sheet_names) -> Table(filename, header, name, rows),None)
2. ConvertScan(Table(filename, header, name, rows) -> Rows(ages),None)
3. FilteredScan(Rows(ages), Filter(The table contains the patient age.))

FilteredScan depends on Table.rows/header
ConvertScan(Table(filename, header, name, rows) -> Rows(ages),None) depends on Table.rows/header

Theoretically, FilteredScan and ConvertScan don't have guaranteed oders. Currently we're using execution data from
sentinel plan to know which order will cost less. 
1) planner knows for FilteredScan we only need to send Header to LLM to determine if this table contains Ages.
2) so that FilteredScan can be executed first.
3) Just one logical plan will be generated.

If reasoning doesn't work here, it will fallback to the original brute force way:
1) can we make good abstract data example when asking LLM for FilteredScan/ConvertScan?
2) When nothing is generated from LLM (filter, convert) by leveraging LLM planning/reasoning, we should fallback to the brute force way and truct the results.
3) We should work on how to operators, then expand this kind of optimization to Plan level.
    Q: In order to implement X operator on Y data, what part of Y data do we really need?
