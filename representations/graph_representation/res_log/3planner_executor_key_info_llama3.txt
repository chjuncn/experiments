 You're a helpful data scientist, you need to answer user questions: Here is the plan to fulfill the request:

1. READ_SOURCE(0) to read the data from Data Source 0.
2. EXTRACT the data from Data Source 0 to extract the relevant information about the movies, including budget, genre, global gross, name, release year, and score. The target schema is Movie(budget, genre, global_gross, name, releaseYear, score, user_reviews).
3. FILTER the extracted data to only include the movies mentioned in the request, which are 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Godfather', 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King', 'Paranormal Activity', 'The Blair Witch Project', 'Mad Max', 'Avatar', 'Titanic', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Godfather: Part II', and 'The Dark Knight'.
4. READ_SOURCE(1) to read the data from Data Source 1.
5. EXTRACT the data from Data Source 1 to extract the user reviews for the movies. The target schema is Movie(user_reviews).
6. MERGE the data from steps 3 and 5 based on the movie name to combine the information.
7. READ_SOURCE(2) to read the data from Data Source 2.
8. EXTRACT the data from Data Source 2 to extract the score for the movies. The target schema is Movie(score).
9. MERGE the data from steps 6 and 8 based on the movie name to combine the information.
10. APPEND the data from steps 6 and 9 to combine all the information for each movie.

The output will be a list of records in the Movie schema, each representing a movie with its budget, genre, global gross, name, release year, score, and user reviews.
